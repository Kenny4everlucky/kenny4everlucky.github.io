[**Project**](https://github.com/Kenny4everlucky/FEDQR_dataset) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
-  The proposed approach improves the accuracy rate, qualified rate, sharpness and computational efficiency. 
-  A novel feature enhanced mechanism is proposed to introduce the correlation coefficient as the prior knowledge of the neural network. 
-  The proposed approach can provide an excellent forecasting performance in the constraints of low data volume.
